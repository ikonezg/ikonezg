## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Marko Berger.

I am a senior Angular Front-end developer with 5.5 years of experience in software development. I started using computers in 1987.
When I wrote my first "Hello World!" computer program on Commodore 64 BASIC. Since then I was always into computer technology as it evolved. 
Now my technology stack is based on JavaScript / TypeScript programming languages and Angular framework. Also in my professional career,
I have worked with Nx.monorepo, Ionic, .NET Core, C#, Node.js, Express.js NestJs and GO. I love brainstorming and working in creative teams. 
If I would describe myself, I would say "I'm a project-driven team player developer".
